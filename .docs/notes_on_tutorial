** Using this doc to track steps, difficulties and tips on redwoodJS tutorial */*

Set up from scratch; moved rewoodblog folder from default location in root directory to
RedwoodJS folder in the Documents folder after setting up and running yarn rw dev the first time.
No issues with the move other than having to browse to the correct directory before running yarn rw dev again
